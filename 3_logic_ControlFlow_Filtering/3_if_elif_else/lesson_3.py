Add else
On the right, the if construct for room has been extended with an else statement so that "looking around elsewhere." is printed if the condition room == "kit" evaluates to False.

Can you do a similar thing to add more functionality to the if construct for area?

Instruction
Add an else statement to the second control structure so that "pretty small." is printed out if area > 15 evaluates to False.
"""

# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
else:
    print("pretty small.")

"""
Nice! Again, feel free to play around with different values of room and area some more. 
After, head over to the next exercise where you'll take this customization one step further!
